# RankBank - Rank Anything and Everything 
App Blueprint

A simple app for creating and managing ranked lists of anything — favorite songs, movies, trips, etc.

---

## Overview

**Purpose:**  
To provide a minimalist, intuitive app where users can create, edit, and reorder personal ranked lists.

---

## Core Features

- **Custom Named Lists**
  - Users can create multiple lists with unique titles (e.g., “Top Movies”, “Favorite Vacations”).

- **Manual Ranking System**
  - Each list allows items to be reordered via drag-and-drop.
  - Items are automatically numbered according to their order.

- **Easy Item Management**
  - Users can add new items to a list quickly.
  - Items can be deleted or edited with a simple UI.

- **List Dashboard**
  - Start screen shows all created lists with options to view or create a new one.

---

## Nice-to-Have Features

- **Notes or Comments**
  - Each item in a list can have optional notes or descriptions.

- **Tags & Filtering**
  - Users can tag items (e.g., genre, mood) and filter within lists.

- **Categorical Sorting**
  - Option to group items into labeled sections (e.g., “Great,” “Good,” “Okay”) rather than strict rankings.

- **Offline Mode**
  - App works offline and syncs if connected later.

- **Minimalist UI**
  - Lightweight design with focus on usability, not features overload.

---

## Optional/Advanced Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**
  - iOS (SwiftUI) first, but Android/Web considered in roadmap.

- **Collaboration & Sharing**
  - Shareable lists, either as read-only or editable by others.

- **Export Options**
  - Export list to CSV, PDF, or shareable link.

---

## What to Avoid

- No bloated task manager features.
- No gamification or social networking mechanics.
- Avoid forcing users into complex flows — keep it instant and intuitive.
